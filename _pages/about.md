I am an Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Rabat, Morocco. I hold an engineering degree from the first Moroccan Design and Technology Engineering School (2014), a dual research master’s degree in Industrial Engineering from the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne, France (2014), and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Aix-Marseille University, France (2018).

My research interests focus on sequential modeling and multimodal deep learning for understanding the dynamics of human–machine interactions. In particular, I am interested in integrating structured data such as natural language and visual information with less structured modalities like brain activity.

Beyond research, I have a strong passion for teaching and supervision. At the International Artificial Intelligence Center of Morocco (Ai Movement), I currently teach modules on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. I also supervise Ph.D. students conducting research closely aligned with my research area, particularly in large language models, multimodal AI, and brain decoding.
